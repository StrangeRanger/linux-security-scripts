# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v2.1.0 - 2025-08-09

### Added

- **Session backup system**: Automatic restoration during script interruptions with temporary backup preservation for manual recovery
- **Cross-platform SSH service restart**: Automatically detects and restarts either `sshd` or `ssh` service based on distribution
- **Enhanced signal handling**: Proper restoration and cleanup on script interruption (SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM)

### Changed

- **Backup strategy**: Dual backup system with permanent `.bak` file for user reference and session backup for auto-restoration
- **Exit handling**: Strategic use of `clean_exit` function only when cleanup or restoration is needed
