This repository is a collection of scripts designed to secure/harden Linux based Distributions.

For information on each of the scripts, visit the [repo wiki](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/linux-security-scripts/wiki). Each page will provide information on the script in question, example output, and a changelog.

## Getting Started

### Downloading

All you need to do is download the repository. There are no binaries or anything to install.

`git clone https://github.com/StrangeRanger/linux-security-scripts`

## Usage

A majority of the scripts will require root privilege to be executed:

`sudo ./[script name]` OR `sudo bash [script name]`

## Tested On

Below is a list of Linux Distributions that all of the scripts have been tested and confirmed to work on.

| Distributions | Distro Versions |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Ubuntu        | 20.04, 18.04    |
| Debian        | 10, 9           |

## Other Resources

This repository is still a work in progress. While it has scripts that can help secure Linux, it's not nearly enough to secure the system as much as it needs to be. Below is a list of other resources that you can use to help make your system as secure as possible.

- [SSH Audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit) - SSH server & client auditing (banner, key exchange, encryption, mac, compression, compatibility, security, etc).
